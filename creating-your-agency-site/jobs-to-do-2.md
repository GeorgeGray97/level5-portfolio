# Jobs to do, part 2: Building

We want everyone to try building the CSS and HTML for your group's site, based on the branding you've already developed. If you all work on the code, it'll be easier to catch bugs and test your site.

## Header

Start by copying the code from the codepen in the HTML comment into your page. Now you have to decide (if you have a logo) how to add your logo into the page. You could create a .jpg or use an .svg file.

## Team introduction

How does your group work? How will you convince people you are a professional, trustworthy agency? This is what your copy needs to do. Once your group is happy with the introduction, mark it up and add it to your group's template. 

When you come to style the introduction, could you add some interesting typography? How will you connect the introduction to the links to the submission points? Do you need to modify the link text to make it more obvious to your site visitors where the links are going?

## Call to action

A 'call to action' or CTA is a really obvious button that you want people to click. Discuss in your group examples of CTAs, e.g. those on [wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/) or [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/gb/).

Style the link to your portfolio page as a CTA: here's some code to start you off:

You might want to use a contrasting colour or a gradient to make it more 'button like'. Make sure it matches the rest of your site - the balance is to make it stand out but not make it totally different to everything else.

## Team bios

Use the codepen as a starting point. Think about the photography or illustration style you're going to use. Are you going to create a corporate atmosphere by having all the portraits in the same style, or be more anarchic and let everyone do their own thing?

## Footer

Web design is all about details. Even though the footer is pretty unexciting, you should care about everything on your agency page - don't give your client any reason to mistrust you!

For example, check your footer links - are they readable against the background? Have you updated the footer code with your group's name?. Ask us if you aren't sure how to write the CSS to just 'target' links in the footer.
