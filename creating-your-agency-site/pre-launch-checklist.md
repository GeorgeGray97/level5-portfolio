# Pre-launch Checklist

We would like everyone to build a version of the group site first, then as a group to decide which will be submitted for SP1. 

You can collaborate on a final version that uses work from any or all group members.

Before you upload your final group site for us to look at, have you:

✏️ checked the metadata and title tags in the &gt;head&lt; of your site?
✏️ Added a header image which includes your team's logo?
✏️ Written an introduction to your team?
✏️ Styled the list of links for each Submission point?
✏️ Created a 'call to action' to the portfolio page (the portfolio page will eventually form the list of documents you need to have in your portfolio for your final submission)
✏️ Added a team member profile
✏️ Added optimised team member images
✏️ Checked and completed the footer content
✏️ Checked your team site in multiple web browsers

🔦 These are what we will be looking at when we give you feedback on this submission point.

😃 If your group works well during this short 'sprint' you should be fine when you come to create your Manchester guide website. 

😭 If you feel the group is having issues, or that the site could have been better, talk to us now before things get any worse 😱.
