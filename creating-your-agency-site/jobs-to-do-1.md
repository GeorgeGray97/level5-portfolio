# Jobs to do: part 1

Your group will be creating a guide to Manchester as your main project this year.

Each group will act as a self-contained web design agency. And like all good agencies, you need a website for your group to show off your talents.

**So Submission Point 1 (usually abbreviated to SP1) is to create a website for your group.**

Here's an example of what we mean. This is [Pentagram's website](https://www.pentagram.com/) and here's [some work they've done for a rather large client in the UK](https://www.pentagram.com/work/the-john-lewis-partnership).

So here are some of the things you need to create as part of completing SP1:
* A colour scheme (not just one colour) for your agency site
* A logo for your agency
* Typography for your agency
* Content for your site (are you projecting a [fun and exciting image](https://getcoleman.com/)? Or trying to be [more trustworthy and corporate](https://clarkecreatives.com/)?)

## Branding your agency

#### Where do you start? 

A name is an obvious place to start, but don't be too critical at this stage. You want lots of ideas rather than 'prematurely optimising' for one. Let everyone in the group think about it and see if there's one solution that everyone likes.

This is how designers like to think: working out the problem leads to a solution. So in this case, one way of stating the problem is 'we have no name'. You can then expand on the problem: 'what name works for all of us AND explains to people what we do?'. By thinking hard about the problem you can come up with a solution.

#### Visual inspiration

At the same time you could give people in the group the job of finding some design inspiration: try
* [Brand New](https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/)
* [Site Inspire](https://www.siteinspire.com/)
* [A list we put together of agency websites](https://github.com/wilsonderren/website-inspiration)

When you're looking at these sites, screenshot them and analyse what you like about them. Is it the choice of typeface? Use of white space? Style of imagery? Discuss this in your group, so you can come to agreement about what you like and how you think this is applicable for your agency.

#### Find some type and try it out.

You might want to 'audition' some typefaces. Watch the video for how to do it. Try some of your names in different typefaces. What looks good? Sometimes you'll be lucky and the first thing you try will be perfect.

#### Do you need a 'logo'?

Sometimes the type, or slightly modified type on its own might be enough - see Pentagram above for an example. Sometimes a logo can help communicate something about your group. What's important is to **get feedback early** from others in the group - don't spend five hours creating a beautiful logo on your own that the rest of the group rejects. Try and prototype quickly and ask each other's opinions.

#### Sketch and experiment

Start prototyping and bringing things together by sketching on paper or using something like Figma.

#### Colours

Colours can be hard. Use something like [] to generate a colour scheme - you might want to choose an 'anchor' colour (e.g. orange for easyJet, green for Lloyds) and see what other colours work well with that. Again, look at what other people are doing.

## HTML for your agency site

You also need some code. Here's how to get started.

The HTML doesn't contain all the code you need. However it does contain comments telling you where to find CSS and HTML code that you can modify to fit your needs.
