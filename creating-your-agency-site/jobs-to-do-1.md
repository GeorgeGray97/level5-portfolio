# Jobs to do: part 1

Your group will be creating a guide to Manchester as your main project this year.

Each group will act as a self-contained web design agency. And like all good agencies, you need a website for your group to show off your talents.

**So Submission Point 1 (usually abbreviated to SP1) is to create a website for your group.**

Here's an example of what we mean. This is [Pentagram's website](https://www.pentagram.com/) and here's [some work they've done for a rather large client in the UK](https://www.pentagram.com/work/the-john-lewis-partnership).

So here are some of the things you need to create as part of completing SP1:
* A colour scheme (not just one colour)
* A logo for your agency
* Typography for your agency
* Content for your site (are you projecting a [fun and exciting image](https://getcoleman.com/)? Or trying to be [more trustworthy and corporate](https://clarkecreatives.com/)?)

You also need some code.

## HTML for your agency site

Here's how to get started.

The HTML doesn't contain all the code you need. However it does contain comments telling you where to find CSS and HTML code that you can modify to fit your needs.
