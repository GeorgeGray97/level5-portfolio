Before you start creating a website, you need to have thought about why the website needs to exist. What problem is it solving? Who will use it? What jobs do those users want to do?

## The brief - Ideation
    
Initial ideas - You will be introduced in class to a variety of ideation techniques, allowing the team to 'brainstorm' and define a number of initial ideas for the project web site (the Guide).
    
### Output

Scan any resulting documents (photograph if too big) and save as a single pdf file. Filename - `ideation.pdf`. Save to the `docs` folder.

*This document will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP1. It is marked at SP5.*

- The above indicates that we will mark the final version of this document at Submission Point 5. 
    
- At Submission Point 1 we will review the current version of your document and provide feedback and guidance. 
    
- You should take the opportunity after SP1 to use our feedback to improve your submission.

- Use subsequent sprint meetings to show us revised versions.

- Of course you may have got it right first time! Job done.

## The brief - User Research
    
User Research - Undertake some initial user research with friends, family and fellow students to better understand what people would want from the guide you are proposing. Use the [BBC User Research template](../../raw/master/templates/template_user_research.docx) document.
    
Each team member should develop 4 or 5 user profiles. Note - these are not Personas (developed later). These should be based on real people.

You are trying to get the thoughts of 'real' people about the type of product you are about to build (and their experience of similar products).
    
### Output

Save as a single docx file. Filename - `user_research.docx`. Save to the `docs` folder.

*Your user research will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP1. It is marked at SP5.*

## The brief - Proposal
    
Project Proposal - You are required to create a Proposal (1000 words) that provides brief details of the web site you plan to construct. The client briefing and user research will help inform this document. 

The proposal becomes an agreement between your team and the client about vision and direction of the Guide.

Use the [Proposal template document](../../raw/master/templates/template_proposal.docx) provided.
    
### Output

Format - docx file. Filename - `proposal.docx`. Save to the `docs` folder.

*Your proposal will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP1. It is marked at SP5.*
