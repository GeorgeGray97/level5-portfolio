# Jobs to do, part 1: Designing

## What are we doing now?

Your group will be creating a guide to Manchester as your main project this year.

Each group will act as a self-contained web design agency. And like all good agencies, you need a website for your group to show off your talents.

**So Submission Point 1 (usually abbreviated to SP1) is to create a website for your group.**

Here's an example of what we mean. This is [Pentagram's website](https://www.pentagram.com/) and here's [some work they've done for a rather large client in the UK](https://www.pentagram.com/work/the-john-lewis-partnership).

So here are some of the things your group needs to think about before you get into coding:

* A name for your agency
* A colour scheme (not just one colour) for your agency site
* A logo for your agency
* Typography for your agency
* Content for your site (is your 'tone of voice' [fun and irreverent](https://getcoleman.com/)? Or trying to be [more trustworthy and corporate](https://clarkecreatives.com/)?)

## Branding your agency

### Where do you start?

A name is an obvious place to start, but don't be too critical at this stage. You want lots of ideas rather than 'prematurely optimising' for one. Let everyone in the group think about it and see if there's one solution that everyone likes.

This is how designers like to think: working out the problem leads to a solution. So in this case, one way of stating the problem is 'we have no name'. But then you can redefine the problem: 'what name works for all of us AND explains to people what we do?'. By putting the problem into different words you might stumble over a solution.

### Visual inspiration

At the same time you could give people in the group the job of finding some design inspiration: try
* [Brand New](https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/)
* [Site Inspire](https://www.siteinspire.com/)
* [A list we put together of agency websites](https://github.com/wilsonderren/website-inspiration)

When you're looking at these sites, screenshot them and analyse what you like about them. Is it the choice of typeface? Use of white space? Style of imagery? Discuss this in your group, so you can come to agreement about what you like and how you think this is applicable for the clients of your agency.

#### Find some type and try it out.

You might want to 'audition' some typefaces in [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). There's also a list of [some of the best ones on Typewolf](https://www.typewolf.com/google-fonts). Watch the video for how to do it. Try some of your agency names in different typefaces. What looks good? Sometimes you'll be lucky and the first thing you try will be perfect. Make a note of the typeface name so you can get the code for it later.

#### Do you need a 'logo'?

Sometimes a symbol can help communicate something about your group. What's important is to **get feedback early** from others in the group - don't spend five hours creating a beautiful logo on your own that the rest of the group rejects. Try ways of prototyping quickly (on paper?) and ask each other's opinions. You can save the logo as a .jpg, .png or .svg file, depending on how complex it is. Ask us for help about how to prepare your logo.

#### Sketch and experiment

Start prototyping and bringing things together by sketching on paper or using something like [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), Photoshop or Illustrator.

#### Colours

Colours can be hard. Try some of these sites:

* [Picular to start a discussion](https://picular.co/) 
* [Colourable to test colour contrast](https://colorable.jxnblk.com/000000/a2a2a2) 
* [Colour palettes through history](https://colorleap.app/home)
* [A colour calculator like this one to create a palette](https://www.sessions.edu/color-calculator/) 

to generate a colour scheme - you might want to choose an 'anchor' colour (e.g. orange for easyJet, green for Lloyds) and see what other colours work well with that. Again, look at what other websites are doing, and discuss it in the group.

## Create your style guide

Download the style guide code and modify it to document your choices. Try and look at the style guide page on different devices to check the colours look good and that the typefaces are readable.
