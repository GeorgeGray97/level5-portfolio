# Jobs to do, part 3: controlling our content with CSS

## Remove the temporary CSS code

Delete the CSS code in the `<style>` tag and remove the comments from the `<link rel="stylesheet">` section. Refreshing the page in your web browser will bring in a starter stylesheet.

## Start adding styles

You'll mostly be cutting and pasting code here. Work systematically so you can navigate what will turn out to be a reasonably long stylesheet. I like to have the styles for my pages in the same order as the HTML, so the header CSS code would be above the bio CSS code, for example.

### Typography and colour

Start to identify how you can use the typography and colour settings you have from your style guide. Add your google font code, and think about which parts of your page would benefit from using which typeface.

### Header

[Add the CSS code in the codepen](https://codepen.io/wilsondmmu/pen/MGWEzO) then start thinking about how you can add your site's branding through modifying the code. You might add a background image, or test different ways of incorporating your logo.

### Call to action

A 'call to action' or CTA is a really obvious button that you want people to click. Discuss in your group examples of CTAs, e.g. those on [wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/) or [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/gb/).

Style the link to your portfolio page as a CTA - use the code in your style guide as a starting point.

You might want to use a contrasting colour or a gradient to make it more 'button like'. Make sure it matches the rest of your site - the balance is to make it stand out but not make it totally different to everything else.

**Check the CTA works properly on very small or very wide screens.**

### Team bios

[Use the codepen CSS](https://codepen.io/wilsondmmu/pen/yxyQoE) as a starting point and modify it to suit you. You probably don't want the red borders - they are just there so you can see what's going on.

Think about the photography or illustration style you're going to use. Are you going to create a corporate atmosphere by having all the portraits in the same style, or be more anarchic and let everyone do their own thing?

**Check the bio section on small and wide screens** - have a read through the pasted code to see how the media queries add and remove CSS.

### Check the details

Go through and look for details that you can style. For example, check your footer links - are they readable against the background? Have you updated the footer code with your group's name?. Ask us if you aren't sure how to write the CSS to just 'target' links in the footer.

When you come to style the introduction, could you add some interesting typography? How will you visually connect the introduction, to the links, to the submission points, to the call to action? 

## What's next

Well done, you're well on the way. Scroll up and down your site a few times. Is there anything that looks wrong, or needs more work? Be critical about your work, and discuss it in your group.

[Now you need to test and check your work](https://github.com/mmu-webdesign/level5-portfolio/blob/master/INSTRUCTIONS-for-creating-your-agency-site/jobs-to-do-4.md).
