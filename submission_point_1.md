# Submission Point 1 - The Guide 

Download - [SP1 Marksheet](../../raw/master/support/sp1-marksheet.docx) 

## Developing an idea

Before you start creating a website, you need to have thought about why the website needs to exist. What problem is it solving? Who will use it? What jobs do those users want to do?

*Submission Point 1 (SP1) includes developing this team website (plus style guide), your initial ideas for the project, user research and the team proposal for the client*.

---

## The brief - Ideation
    
Initial ideas - You will be introduced in class to a variety of ideation techniques, allowing the team to 'brainstorm' and define a number of initial ideas for the project web site (the Guide).
    
### Output

Scan any resulting documents (photograph if too big) and save as a single pdf file. Filename - `ideation.pdf`. Save to the `docs` folder.

*This document will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP1. It is marked at SP5.*

- The above indicates that we will mark the final version of this document at Submission Point 5. 
    
- At Submission Point 1 we will review the current version of your document and provide feedback and guidance. 
    
- You should take the opportunity after SP1 to use our feedback to improve your submission.

- Use subsequent sprint meetings to show us revised versions.

- Of course you may have got it right first time! Job done.

## The brief - User Research
    
User Research - Undertake some initial user research with friends, family and fellow students to better understand what people would want from the guide you are proposing. Use the [BBC User Research template](../../raw/master/templates/template_user_research.docx) document.
    
Each team member should develop 4 or 5 user profiles. Note - these are not Personas (developed later). These should be based on real people.

You are trying to get the thoughts of 'real' people about the type of product you are about to build (and their experience of similar products).
    
### Output

Save as a single docx file. Filename - `user_research.docx`. Save to the `docs` folder.

*Your user research will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP1. It is marked at SP5.*

---

## The brief - Proposal
    
Project Proposal - You are required to create a Proposal (1000 words) that provides brief details of the web site you plan to construct. The client briefing and user research will help inform this document. 

The proposal becomes an agreement between your team and the client about vision and direction of the Guide.

Use the [Proposal template document](../../raw/master/templates/template_proposal.docx) provided.
    
### Output

Format - docx file. Filename - `proposal.docx`. Save to the `docs` folder.

*Your proposal will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP1. It is marked at SP5.*

## The brief - Peer assessment
    
Peer assessment addresses two concerns about team work:
    
1.  Lazy students may get a mark whether or not they do any work;
1.  Such students may pull down the mark of their more able or conscientious colleagues.

The tutors will award a team mark for the project that will be given to each team member. The team is allowed to moderate this mark up or down, within limits, for each member according to pre-established criteria. Thus each student may receive an individual mark that is different from the marks awarded to other members in their team which reflects their overall contribution to the team assignment.
    
All groups must complete and submit the peer assessment documentation even if the marks are not going to be adjusted.
    
Use the [peer assessment template document](../../raw/master/templates/template_peer_assessment.docx).
    
### Output

For **SP1** download and review the forms . You will be required to print, complete, sign and scan the documents for SP5.

Format - docx file. Filename - `peer_assessment.docx`. Save to the `docs` folder.

## The brief - SP1 Team Style Guide

A style guide documents the visual language, such as header styles and colour palettes, used to create the site. It will indicate the voice, tone and writing style for your content and should be used to define your coding conventions (format â€“ html).

### Further reading

- [Front-end Style Guides](https://24ways.org/2011/front-end-style-guides/) explained by Anna Debenham. 
- Example [style guides and further reading at styleguides.io](http://styleguides.io/).
    
### What to do

Create a style guide for the team website - your colours, media and typography for this site - Use the [template style_guide.html](../../raw/master/templates/template_style_guide.zip).
    
### Output

Format - html file. Filename - `team_style_guide.html`. Save the relevant files to the `teamstyles` folder on the root of your team website.
    
*The team style guide is marked at SP1 - see marksheet*

## SP 1 - What and how to submit.

Submission points 1-4 gives tutors an opportunity to review your work, provide feedback and to check your progress.

For each submission point:

- **SP1** we are reviewing the documents and marking the team website.
- **SP2** we are reviewing the documents and marking the presentation.
- **SP3** - same.
- **SP4** we are marking your preparation and performance in delivering a usability testing session.
- **SP5** we are marking all of the final versions of the documents created through the whole process. We are also marking your project website - The Guide.

## SP1 - What are we reviewing?

We are reviewing and providing feedback on the following documents:
1. Ideation.pdf
1. user_research.docx
1. proposal.docx

They are marked on the final submission (SP5). This iterative feedback allows you to make improvements.

## SP1 - What are we marking?

For SP1 we are marking your `Team Website` and `Team style guide`.

## Marks

SP1 is worth 5% of the overall mark for Assessment One.
