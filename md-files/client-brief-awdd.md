# THE BRIEF - A Guide to Manchester

Your tutors are acting as the client - in this scenario they are representing Manchester Metropolitan University.

## Overview

Manchester Metropolitan University are employing a number of digital agencies (your teams) to create a variety of topic-specific guides to Greater Manchester for students, their friends and families.

Each team should select a topic/focus for the guide they are to create. Examples might include: sports clubs, sports venues, statues, museums, art galleries, coffee shops, restaurants, nightclubs, parks, architecture etc.

You will develop an initial idea for your 'guide' in the early stages of the project. This will be agreed with the client and defined in the proposal document. The proposal helps the client and agency define and agree on what is to be built.

## Key requirements:

-  A modern, attractive website - 25 web pages, a minimum of 10.

-  Focus your guide on one topic, to be confirmed with the client.

-  Creation of an original 'Guide to Manchester' logo.

-  An attractive, contemporary design.

-  Creation of original media. 

    - High quality media including images, text & video.
    
    - All media must be original -- created by your team.*`

-  Responsive web design.

-  The site should be highly usable, following the design for all ethos.

- Accessibility - Conformance to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0. See the accompanying [WCAG checklist](../support/WCAG2_checklist.pdf) and [checklist support](../support/WCAG2_checklist_support.doc) documents (SP5).

- SEO (Search Engine Optimization) - all pages should have relevant titles and meta descriptions for good SEO. All written content should be written with SEO in mind (use of keywords, link text etc.).

`*` *Images, text and video are illustrative. Imagine they are examples to brief some 'in-house' employees on how the rest of the site could be completed. The assignment does not require pages and pages of content. Any content produced must be of a high quality, grammar and spell checked, optimised for the web.*

## Technical requirements

-  All pages must be coded in valid, semantic HTML5. 

-  All presentation must be applied using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for efficient site maintenance and to enable rapid amendment or updating to meet changing operational needs.  

-  The website must be developed to be responsive to various mobile platforms.

- The client wants original coding from the team - no use of frameworks such as BootStrap.

    - If you want to use a chunk of code from a tutorial or such, seek permission from the client (tutors).

-  Any materials used must not infringe copyright or trademarks.

-  The client will provide the MMU logo. Do not use any other versions.

-  A PHP/MySQL database driven section with a listing and detail page.

-  A working PHP contact form that makes sense within your 'site flow'.

-  Fast download speeds.

-  Each page must carry our standard disclaimer -- the text will be provided by the tutors as disclaimer.txt.
