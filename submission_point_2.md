## Who is visiting your site?

You will learn about and use a variety of tools and techniques in your research.

## SP2 includes...

*SP2 includes analysing competitors, creating personas (to represent your users), the user journeys these personas would take and the development of an information architecture, resulting in a site plan*.

---
    
## The brief - Competitor Analysis
    
Competitor Analysis Report - As a team, you are required to review 3 web sites that are similar to the type of site you are building – a guide. These sites may be local, UK-based or overseas (if relevant).
    
You could for example look at any direct, local competitor guides, guides for other cities, examples of good guides (on any topic), and perhaps like guides that are part of larger sites. Avoid Trip Advisor. Analyse the 3 sites using the criteria on the [Competitor Analysis template](../../raw/master/templates/template_competitor_analysis.docx) provided.
    
### Output

Format - docx file. Filename - `competitor_analysis.docx`. Save to the `docs` folder.

*Your competitor analysis will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP2 Presentation. It is marked at SP5.*

## The brief - Personas
    
User Personas - Create 3 user personas based on the user types your research indicates you might expect to use your group’s web site.
    
One must be an international visitor to your site
    
We prefer you to be creative and develop your own personas over using a template site. If you use a template make sure you customise the output.
    
### Output

Format - pdf file. Filename - `personas.pdf`. Save to the `docs` folder.

*Your personas will be reviewed as part of the SP2 Presentation. They are marked at SP5.*

## The brief - User Journeys
    
User Journey Mapping - **Develop a user journey for each persona**. Explore what type of interaction(s) these users might typically have with the site. Read the article [When and How to Create Customer Journey Maps](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/customer-journey-mapping/).
    
Use the [User Journey template document](../../raw/master/templates/template_user_journey.pptx) we have created from [Paul Boag's article](https://boagworld.com/usability/customer-journey-mapping/).
    
### Output

Format - docx file. Filename - `user_journey.docx`. Save to the `docs` folder.

*A sample user journey will be reviewed as part of the SP2 Presentation. They all are marked at SP5.*

## The brief - Information Architecture
    
Information Architecture Report - The team must carry out and record an open card sort and tree jacking exercise to inform your initial site architecture. This will be illustrated as a site plan.
    
Write a short (500 words) illustrated report on the process and results.
    
Use the [report template document](../../raw/master/templates/template_ia_report.docx).
    
### Output

Format - docx file. Filename - `ia_report.docx`. Save to the `docs` folder.

Card Sort Results - Using paper cards undertake an Open Card sort as (illustrated in class) as a group to get an initial understanding. Then carry out the sort with UserZoom on at least 10 participants. Discuss and illustrate the results in your IA Report.
    
Create an xlsx spreadsheet of your results.
    
### Output

Format - xlsx file. Filename - card_sort.xlsx. Save to the `docs` folder.

*A summary of the card sort will be reviewed as part of the SP2 Presentation - it may be incomplete at this stage.  It is marked at SP5.*

Site Plan - This is an illustration of your recommended architecture for the new site based on the findings of your card sorting exercise. You MUST use the formatting illustrated in class. By the end of the project you may have a number of iterations of this plan due to changes as you progress with the project.
    
Use the [site plan template document](../../raw/master/templates/template_site_plan.pptx).
    
You can use the tools in PowerPoint to create a simple tree structure.
